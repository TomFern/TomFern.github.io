![Me](/images/mountains.jpg)

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tommy Fernandez, I live in Argentina and I'm a technical writer at Semaphoreci.com.

I've written a bit about why I decided to start writing in this [post](/posts/what-got-me-writing). Before writing, I worked in IT for many, many years, where Iâ€™ve wore many hats: sysadmin, dba, developer. Iâ€™ve loved them all.

As for hobbies, I love learning languages, sailing, boardgaming and swimming. 

I'm so glad you're here.

-Tommy
