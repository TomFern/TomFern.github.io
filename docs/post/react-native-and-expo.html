    <p>I’ve started my career as a backend developer. Pretty early on, I had to get familiar the console and chose Vim as my main editor. Afterwards, as a sysadmin and dba I lived in ssh sessions. It’s great, I love it, but when it’s time to switch to the frontend I struggle.</p>

<p>Imagine my hapiness when I found about a project that lets me code for mobile without leaving the command line.</p>

<h2 id="react-native-and-expo">React Native and Expo</h2>

<p>React Native is a Facebook project that converts Javascript into native Android and iOS code. Using one language for both platforms is definetly enticing and conventient.</p>

<p>Expo is an official React Native project that lets you do without full featured IDEs like Android Studio.</p>

<p>https://expo.io/</p>

<p>Curious about how it worked, I tried it for a few days and here’s the result.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h2>

<p>We only need Node.js to get started:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>npm <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-g</span> expo-cli
<span class="nv">$ </span>expo init
? Choose a template: <span class="o">(</span>Use arrow keys<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="nt">-----</span> Managed workflow <span class="nt">-----</span>
❯ blank                 a minimal app as clean as an empty canvas
blank <span class="o">(</span>TypeScript<span class="o">)</span>    same as blank but with TypeScript configuration
tabs                  several example screens and tabs using react-navigation
<span class="nt">-----</span> Bare workflow <span class="nt">-----</span>
minimal               bare and minimal, just the essentials to get you started
minimal <span class="o">(</span>TypeScript<span class="o">)</span>  same as minimal but with TypeScript configuration
<span class="nv">$ </span>npm <span class="nb">install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<!--
$ npm install --save-dev

$ npm install --save-dev jest
-->

<h2 id="running">Running</h2>

<p>Running the application is as easy as:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>npm run start
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The command starts a bunch of processes, including a local dashboard running on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:19002</code>.</p>

<p>The quickest way of viewing the application is by scanning the QR code with your phone and running it on the physical device.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can run the application in a virtual device if you have installed the emulator (Android Studio and avd)</p>

<!-- - Web?
-->

<h2 id="building">Building</h2>

<p>The Expo platform offers a cloud build service. Compiling an Android package is as easy as:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>expo build:android
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After a few minutes, you’ll find the signed APK from the website, ready to upload to the Play Store.</p>

<h2 id="ejecting">Ejecting</h2>

<p>The Expo build service is nice but it can get inflexible. I’d like to be able to do End-to-End testing, and manage the project entirely in my CI/CD workflow instead of depending on 3rd parties.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Expo can create native Android and iOS projects that are will feel familiar to mobile developers.</p>

<p>To get these files, we must eject the project. The price we pay is that we no longer can build it from the Expo service:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>expo eject
? How would you like to eject your app?
Read more: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/eject/ <span class="o">(</span>Use arrow keys<span class="o">)</span>
❯ Bare: I<span class="s1">'d like a bare React Native project.
ExpoKit: I'</span>ll create or log <span class="k">in </span>with an Expo account to use React Native and the Expo SDK.
Cancel: I<span class="s1">'ll continue with my current project structure.
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, Expo may not be the best alternative for every case: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/why-not-expo/</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">android</code> directory can be opened by Android Studio. We can compile an APK with gradle and run the project in an emulator as usual.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Expo is a nice alternative to full-featured IDEs. We can prototype pretty quickly a mobile project and when it’s time for more serious work. We can get a good Android project.</p>
