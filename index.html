Being the default registry for Docker images, this is one of the biggest in the ecosystem in the last few years, and it will affect not only Docker users but also Kubernetes setups.
The limits 🔗The new limits affect free users. No more unlimited free pulls, the party is over.
Anonymous free users: 100 container pulls every 6 hours.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/programming-humans/>Programming humans</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2020-11-03 07:00:00 -0300 -03">Nov 3, 2020</time></div></div><div class=summary>While working on the slides for the talk I gave a few weeks ago, it occurred to me that writing and coding have more than a few things in common. I originally planned to speak a bit about that but had to take it out for lack of space. I’ll make a post instead, this one.
Thinks in common 🔗Language
Both writing and coding use a language. Writing happens in any of the hundreds of languages people speak all over the world.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/talk-technical-writing-in-english/>Talk: Technical writing in English</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2020-10-21 07:00:00 -0300 -03">Oct 21, 2020</time></div></div><div class=summary>I gave a talk about technical writing at nerdear.la, a bilingual convention about technology and people that took place October 2020 in Argentina.
The Talk 🔗The slides are in English, the talk is in Spanish. At the end of the talk, I’ll be answering questions.

Pretty early on, I had to get familiar the console and chose Vim as my main editor. Afterwards, as a sysadmin and dba I lived in ssh sessions. It’s great, I love it, but when it’s time to switch to the frontend I struggle.
Imagine my hapiness when I found about a project that lets me code for mobile without leaving the command line.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/what-got-me-writing/>What Got Me Writing</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2020-08-08 07:00:00 -0300 -03">Aug 8, 2020</time></div></div><div class=summary>When I started freelancing, I never imagined I would end up writing for a living. Never in a hundred years. Yet, I’ve been doing it full-time for almost a year now.
I got interested in freelancing because I wanted to try something different. I needed a break from the office routine. The job was OK. I had excellent colleagues and was friends with everyone. And while it wasn’t making me rich by any means, I never lacked for anything.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/7-minikube-tips/>7 Minikube Tips</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2020-06-28 14:04:00 -0300 -03">Jun 28, 2020</time></div></div><div class=summary>I love my Arch Linux, which I’ve been using it for years, more than I care to count. But sometimes I believe that all of us Linux users, deep in our heart of hearts, have some Windows- or Mac-only software that we covet.
For me, that software is Docker Desktop; not much for the sake of Docker, but mainly for the standalone Kubernetes cluster.
I’m afraid I can’t give you Docker Desktop for Linux, but I’ll offer the next best thing instead:</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/10-vim-plugins-for-writers/>10 Vim Plugins for Writers</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2019-12-15 14:04:00 -0300 -03">Dec 15, 2019</time></div></div><div class=summary>I still remember the first time I came in contact with Vim; it was during my very first job. It was a part-time gig in a government office. A few months in, they decided to go open-source full in. Out the window went Windows and in came Linux. At the time, I was doing PHP development, and I was sorry to have to let go of my dear Dreamweaver.
I decided that if I had to work on Linux, I would go all the way, no compromises for me.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/case-study-mariadb-columnstore/>Case study: MariaDB ColumnStore</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2019-03-04 15:29:00 -0300 -03">Mar 4, 2019</time></div></div><div class=summary>A recent project I worked on provided an opportunity to work with MariaDB ColumnStore.
The Product 🔗The product is a business intelligence application. Its main view, a very comprehensive dashboard with an abundance of counters, showing all operational aspects: from server status, database backups, support tickets and SLA to datacenter atmospheric conditions.
In the middle of all this: several MariaDB databases fed through multiple ETL jobs.
As the application grew, the dashboard got increasingly more intricate.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/making-the-most-out-of-docker/>Making the most out of Docker</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2019-02-02 11:21:00 -0300 -03">Feb 2, 2019</time></div></div><div class=summary>Some options that might increase performance, some that don’t.
Network 🔗Containers get connected to a bridge network by default. A software bridge that allows communication between containers running on the same host & bridge. We can also create and use custom bridges, to create isolated groups of containers. To allow connections from outside, we must map the host’s ports to a container’s with -p (publish e.g. -p 3306:3306) This is easy and flexible, but it makes Docker start an additional process (docker-proxy), which can use a non-trivial amount of CPU.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/a-container-for-my-databases/>A Container for My Databases</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2019-01-18 17:59:00 -0300 -03">Jan 18, 2019</time></div></div><div class=summary>Who doesn’t like containers? Anyone doesn’t like to have most of the benefits of virtual machines with much, much less overhead?
They’ve been around since forever (anyone still remember chroot?) but only in recent years their popularity boomed, mainly due to cloud computing, I’m sure.
I’ve been running databases in docker for a while now. I was curious about other alternatives, so I did a bit of benchmarking.
Docker 🔗It’s not a coincidence that Docker appeared around the same time container technology began its popularity rise.</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=next><a href=/page/2/>Older posts <span class=arrow>→</span></a></span></div></div></main><footer id=footer><div id=social><a class=symbol href=https://github.com/TomFern rel=me target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" viewBox="0 0 72 72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>Github</title><desc>Created with Sketch.</desc><defs/><g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Social-Icons---Rounded-Black" transform="translate(-264.000000, -939.000000)"><g id="Github" transform="translate(264.000000, 939.000000)"><path d="M8 72H64c4.418278.0 8-3.581722 8-8V8c0-4.418278-3.581722-8-8-8H8c-4.418278 811624501e-24-8 3.581722-8 8V64c541083001e-24 4.418278 3.581722 8 8 8z" id="Rounded" fill="#bbb"/><path d="M35.9985 13C22.746 13 12 23.7870921 12 37.096644c0 10.6440272 6.876 19.6751861 16.4145 22.8617681C29.6145 60.1797862 30.0525 59.4358488 30.0525 58.7973276 30.0525 58.2250681 30.0315 56.7100863 30.0195 54.6996482c-6.6765 1.4562499-8.085-3.2302544-8.085-3.2302544-1.0905-2.7829884-2.664-3.5239139-2.664-3.5239139C17.091 46.4500754 19.4355 46.4801943 19.4355 46.4801943c2.4075.1701719 3.675 2.4833051 3.675 2.4833051 2.142 3.6820383 5.6175 2.6188404 6.9855 2.0014024C30.3135 49.4077535 30.9345 48.3460615 31.62 47.7436831 26.2905 47.1352808 20.688 45.0691228 20.688 35.8361671c0-2.6308879.9345-4.781379 2.4705-6.4665327C22.911 28.7597262 22.0875 26.3110578 23.3925 22.9934585c0 0 2.016-.6475568 6.6 2.4697516C31.908 24.9285993 33.96 24.6620468 36.0015 24.6515052 38.04 24.6620468 40.0935 24.9285993 42.0105 25.4632101c4.581-3.1173084 6.5925-2.4697516 6.5925-2.4697516C49.9125 26.3110578 49.089 28.7597262 48.8415 29.3696344 50.3805 31.0547881 51.309 33.2052792 51.309 35.8361671c0 9.2555448-5.6115 11.29309-10.9575 11.8894446.860999999999997.7439374 1.629 2.2137408 1.629 4.4621184C41.9805 55.4089489 41.9505 58.0067059 41.9505 58.7973276 41.9505 59.4418726 42.3825 60.1918338 43.6005 59.9554002 53.13 56.7627944 60 47.7376593 60 37.096644 60 23.7870921 49.254 13 35.9985 13" fill="#fff"/></g></g></g></svg></a><a class=symbol href=https://github.com/TomFernBlog rel=me target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" id="Capa_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="438.536" height="438.536" viewBox="0 0 438.536 438.536" style="enable-background:new 0 0 438.536 438.536"><g><path d="M414.41 24.123C398.333 8.042 378.963.0 356.315.0H82.228C59.58.0 40.21 8.042 24.126 24.123 8.045 40.207.003 59.576.003 82.225v274.084c0 22.647 8.042 42.018 24.123 58.102 16.084 16.084 35.454 24.126 58.102 24.126h274.084c22.648.0 42.018-8.042 58.095-24.126 16.084-16.084 24.126-35.454 24.126-58.102V82.225C438.532 59.576 430.49 40.204 414.41 24.123zM335.471 168.735c.191 1.713.288 4.278.288 7.71.0 15.989-2.334 32.025-6.995 48.104-4.661 16.087-11.8 31.504-21.416 46.254-9.606 14.749-21.074 27.791-34.396 39.115-13.325 11.32-29.311 20.365-47.968 27.117-18.648 6.762-38.637 10.143-59.953 10.143-33.116.0-63.76-8.952-91.931-26.836 4.568.568 9.329.855 14.275.855 27.6.0 52.439-8.565 74.519-25.7-12.941-.185-24.506-4.179-34.688-11.991-10.185-7.803-17.273-17.699-21.271-29.691 4.947.76 8.658 1.137 11.132 1.137 4.187.0 9.042-.76 14.56-2.279-13.894-2.669-25.598-9.562-35.115-20.697-9.519-11.136-14.277-23.84-14.277-38.114v-.571c10.085 4.755 19.602 7.229 28.549 7.422-17.321-11.613-25.981-28.265-25.981-49.963.0-10.66 2.758-20.747 8.278-30.264 15.035 18.464 33.311 33.213 54.816 44.252 21.507 11.038 44.54 17.227 69.092 18.558-.95-3.616-1.427-8.186-1.427-13.704.0-16.562 5.853-30.692 17.56-42.399 11.703-11.706 25.837-17.561 42.394-17.561 17.515.0 32.079 6.283 43.688 18.846 13.134-2.474 25.892-7.33 38.26-14.56-4.757 14.652-13.613 25.788-26.55 33.402 12.368-1.716 23.88-4.95 34.537-9.708C357.458 149.793 347.462 160.166 335.471 168.735z"/></g></svg></a></div><div class=copyright>© Copyright
