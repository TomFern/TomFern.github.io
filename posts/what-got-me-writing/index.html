Never in a hundred years. Yet, I&rsquo;ve been doing it full-time for almost a year now.</p><p>I got interested in freelancing because I wanted to try something different. I needed a break from the office routine. The job was OK. I had excellent colleagues and was friends with everyone. And while it wasn&rsquo;t making me rich by any means, I never lacked for anything. It was a comfortable job‚Äîperhaps too much.</p><p>The trouble was that going to the office got harder and harder as time passed. It got to the point that I started sensing that the whole thing was a terrible waste of time. Meetings and busywork consumed most of my and everyone else&rsquo;s workday. Going back and forth to the office four days a week (+1 home office day) took too long and squandered too much energy. At least that&rsquo;s how I perceived it.</p><p>Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I know meetings and some degree of paperwork is unavoidable. I do. I&rsquo;m fine with that. I made my peace with that; it&rsquo;s just how companies work. But there is a point where bureaucracy takes over, and I felt we had long gone past it.</p><p>At first I thought that maybe I needed to change jobs. So I updated my resume, went to a few interviews, and even landed an offer that would have meant a substantial pay bump. In all honesty, when it was time to make the decision, I realized that I wasn&rsquo;t too excited about the change‚Äîit felt like swapping one office for another. I realized that more money just wouldn&rsquo;t cut it.</p><p>One friend who was already a freelancer recommended me to try Upwork. The way he described it sounded great, just what I needed. So I created a profile and started sending proposals for jobs I thought I could do.</p><p>Freelancing was a whole new and intimidating universe. It was exciting and scary. I did a few programming jobs here and there, I coded a chatbot, I did some database migrations.</p><p>One day I saw a job post asking for a 2000-word PHP installation tutorial. I knew PHP and MySQL pretty well, so I figured that it was easy money. By that time, I already had a personal blog with a few posts, and I thought that alone qualified me. So, without thinking too much about it, I sent my proposal. After all, how long could it take? Two thousand words&mldr; easy peasy, piece of cake&mldr; easy as falling off a log.</p><p>I landed the job and said I would have it in 2 days, 3 tops.</p><p>Boy, did I planning-fallacy-ed the thing&mldr;</p><p>I spend 2 entire days just writing down the steps and taking screenshots. Then 3 more writing the damn thing (all this while I did my daytime job). It dawned on me that proper writing is much harder than blogging for fun. It was exhausting, fun, and sleep-depriving. And when the draft got accepted, I was incredibly proud.</p><p>That was the point I started considering writing as a job.</p><p>In the following months, a lot of people were very kind and let me write for them. One person took a big chance and gave me enough work to take the plunge and try writing as a full-time job, for which I&rsquo;ll be eternally grateful.</p><h1 id=so-what-i-like-about-writing>So, what I like about writing <a href=#so-what-i-like-about-writing class=anchor>üîó</a></h1><p><strong>It&rsquo;s different</strong></p><p>Professional writing is different than any other job I had. For me, it&rsquo;s the perfect mix of learning, playing, and working.</p><p><strong>It&rsquo;s challenging</strong></p><p>Putting words on paper is easy. Making them make sense and tell a story, not so much. Finding the correct tone, showing just the right amount of information, and figuring out how best to deliver is a balancing act. It&rsquo;s the kind of challenge that makes me want to keep trying harder.</p><p><strong>Give something back</strong></p><p>It feels good to contribute, even if it is only a grain of sand in the infinite expanse that is the Internet.</p><p><strong>View things in a different light</strong></p><p>Any text that doesn&rsquo;t consider the audience is destined to fail. Writing forces me to put myself in other people&rsquo;s shoes.</p><p><strong>Has its own pace</strong></p><p>There&rsquo;s no on-call duty, no overtime, no meetings back to back, and (usually) no super-long hours. Within certain limits, I can choose how many hours I want to work.</p><p>The other side of the coin is that staying productive at a consistent pace it&rsquo;s a lot more difficult. Some days I&rsquo;m on fire. Others, I can&rsquo;t write a word to save my life. And there is no way of knowing until I sit and try.</p><p><strong>Learn new things</strong></p><p>Writing is a way of learning. If you ask me, it&rsquo;s one of the best ways. It has given me the chance to play with many wonderful technologies that I otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have paid attention to.</p><p><strong>Defrags the noggin</strong></p><p>Writing forces me to put things down and examine them in the critical light of the narrative. I frequently find that what made sense in the nebulous circumvolutions of the mind breaks down into a mess of disconnected sentences and repeated words as soon as I put them on the screen.</p><p><strong>Relearn old things</strong></p><p>We&rsquo;ve all been tripped by an innocent question while explaining something that we thought we knew well.
Without fail, writing reveals the flaws in our thinking and shows how well (or bad) we understand things.</p><h1 id=give-it-a-try>Give it a try <a href=#give-it-a-try class=anchor>üîó</a></h1><p>Some people say that writing is art. That may be true for the likes of Poe or Bradbury. My problem with calling it art by default is that it puts it on a pedestal. For me, writing is like carpentry. It&rsquo;s a skill that must be honed every day. Something that takes time and effort, sure enough, but is entirely within reach of anyone.</p><p>So give it a try.</p></div><div class=tags><a href=http://tomfern.com/tags/writing>writing</a></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div id=social><a class=symbol href=https://github.com/TomFern rel=me target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" viewBox="0 0 72 72" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>Github</title><desc>Created with Sketch.</desc><defs/><g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Social-Icons---Rounded-Black" transform="translate(-264.000000, -939.000000)"><g id="Github" transform="translate(264.000000, 939.000000)"><path d="M8 72H64c4.418278.0 8-3.581722 8-8V8c0-4.418278-3.581722-8-8-8H8c-4.418278 811624501e-24-8 3.581722-8 8V64c541083001e-24 4.418278 3.581722 8 8 8z" id="Rounded" fill="#bbb"/><path d="M35.9985 13C22.746 13 12 23.7870921 12 37.096644c0 10.6440272 6.876 19.6751861 16.4145 22.8617681C29.6145 60.1797862 30.0525 59.4358488 30.0525 58.7973276 30.0525 58.2250681 30.0315 56.7100863 30.0195 54.6996482c-6.6765 1.4562499-8.085-3.2302544-8.085-3.2302544-1.0905-2.7829884-2.664-3.5239139-2.664-3.5239139C17.091 46.4500754 19.4355 46.4801943 19.4355 46.4801943c2.4075.1701719 3.675 2.4833051 3.675 2.4833051 2.142 3.6820383 5.6175 2.6188404 6.9855 2.0014024C30.3135 49.4077535 30.9345 48.3460615 31.62 47.7436831 26.2905 47.1352808 20.688 45.0691228 20.688 35.8361671c0-2.6308879.9345-4.781379 2.4705-6.4665327C22.911 28.7597262 22.0875 26.3110578 23.3925 22.9934585c0 0 2.016-.6475568 6.6 2.4697516C31.908 24.9285993 33.96 24.6620468 36.0015 24.6515052 38.04 24.6620468 40.0935 24.9285993 42.0105 25.4632101c4.581-3.1173084 6.5925-2.4697516 6.5925-2.4697516C49.9125 26.3110578 49.089 28.7597262 48.8415 29.3696344 50.3805 31.0547881 51.309 33.2052792 51.309 35.8361671c0 9.2555448-5.6115 11.29309-10.9575 11.8894446.860999999999997.7439374 1.629 2.2137408 1.629 4.4621184C41.9805 55.4089489 41.9505 58.0067059 41.9505 58.7973276 41.9505 59.4418726 42.3825 60.1918338 43.6005 59.9554002 53.13 56.7627944 60 47.7376593 60 37.096644 60 23.7870921 49.254 13 35.9985 13" fill="#fff"/></g></g></g></svg></a><a class=symbol href=https://github.com/TomFernBlog rel=me target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" id="Capa_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="438.536" height="438.536" viewBox="0 0 438.536 438.536" style="enable-background:new 0 0 438.536 438.536"><g><path d="M414.41 24.123C398.333 8.042 378.963.0 356.315.0H82.228C59.58.0 40.21 8.042 24.126 24.123 8.045 40.207.003 59.576.003 82.225v274.084c0 22.647 8.042 42.018 24.123 58.102 16.084 16.084 35.454 24.126 58.102 24.126h274.084c22.648.0 42.018-8.042 58.095-24.126 16.084-16.084 24.126-35.454 24.126-58.102V82.225C438.532 59.576 430.49 40.204 414.41 24.123zM335.471 168.735c.191 1.713.288 4.278.288 7.71.0 15.989-2.334 32.025-6.995 48.104-4.661 16.087-11.8 31.504-21.416 46.254-9.606 14.749-21.074 27.791-34.396 39.115-13.325 11.32-29.311 20.365-47.968 27.117-18.648 6.762-38.637 10.143-59.953 10.143-33.116.0-63.76-8.952-91.931-26.836 4.568.568 9.329.855 14.275.855 27.6.0 52.439-8.565 74.519-25.7-12.941-.185-24.506-4.179-34.688-11.991-10.185-7.803-17.273-17.699-21.271-29.691 4.947.76 8.658 1.137 11.132 1.137 4.187.0 9.042-.76 14.56-2.279-13.894-2.669-25.598-9.562-35.115-20.697-9.519-11.136-14.277-23.84-14.277-38.114v-.571c10.085 4.755 19.602 7.229 28.549 7.422-17.321-11.613-25.981-28.265-25.981-49.963.0-10.66 2.758-20.747 8.278-30.264 15.035 18.464 33.311 33.213 54.816 44.252 21.507 11.038 44.54 17.227 69.092 18.558-.95-3.616-1.427-8.186-1.427-13.704.0-16.562 5.853-30.692 17.56-42.399 11.703-11.706 25.837-17.561 42.394-17.561 17.515.0 32.079 6.283 43.688 18.846 13.134-2.474 25.892-7.33 38.26-14.56-4.757 14.652-13.613 25.788-26.55 33.402 12.368-1.716 23.88-4.95 34.537-9.708C357.458 149.793 347.462 160.166 335.471 168.735z"/></g></svg></a></div><div class=copyright>¬© Copyright
