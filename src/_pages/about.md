![Me](/images/mountains.jpg)

👋 My name is Tommy Fernandez, I live in Argentina and I'm a technical writer.

I've written a bit about why I decided to start writing in this [post](/posts/what-got-me-writing). Before writing being freelance writer and full-time technical writer at Semaphore CI/CD, I worked in IT for many, many years, where I’ve wore many hats: sysadmin, dba, developer. I’ve loved them all. 

As for hobbies, I love learning languages, sailing, boardgaming and swimming. 

I'm so glad you're here.

-Tommy
