![Me](/images/sesimbra.jpg)

üëã My name is Tommy Fernandez. I was born in Argentina and now live in beautiful Portugal. I am a technical writer at [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com). You can find my professional writings in the [Semaphore blog](https://semaphoreci.com/author/tfernandez) (where I also act as an editor and reviewer) and [my videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9pxz3ccLeug2c74TKysCC-7ErP0dkqAk) for the Semaphore channel.

I've written a bit about why and how I started writing in [this post](/post/what-got-me-writing). 

As for hobbies, I love learning languages, hiking, board gaming, and swimming.

I'm so glad you're here.

-Tommy
