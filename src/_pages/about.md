![Me](/images/sesimbra.jpg)

👋 My name is Pablo (Tommy) Fernandez. I was born in Argentina and now live in beautiful Portugal. I am a technical writer at [VictoriaMetrics](https://victoriametrics.com).

Before joining VictoriaMetrics, I worked as a Technical Writer for Semaphore. For now, you can find my professional writings in the [Semaphore blog](https://semaphore.io/author/tfernandez) (where I also acted as an editor and reviewer) and [my videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9pxz3ccLeug2c74TKysCC-7ErP0dkqAk) for their YouTube channel.

I've written a bit about why and how I started writing in [this post](/post/what-got-me-writing).

As for hobbies, I love learning languages, hiking, board gaming, and swimming.

I'm so glad you're here.

-Tommy
