![Me](/images/victoria.jpg)

üëã My name is Tommy Fernandez. I live in Argentina and am a technical writer at [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com). You can find my professional writings in the [Semaphore blog](https://semaphoreci.com/author/tfernandez).

I've written a bit about why and how I started writing in [this post](/post/what-got-me-writing). 

As for hobbies, I love learning languages, sailing, board gaming, and swimming. 

I'm so glad you're here.
