I love my Arch Linux, which I've been using it for years, more than I care to count. But sometimes I believe that all of us Linux users, deep in our heart of hearts, have some Windows- or Mac-only software that we covet.

For me, that software is Docker Desktop; not much for the sake of Docker, but mainly for the standalone Kubernetes cluster.

I'm afraid I can't give you Docker Desktop for Linux, but I'll offer the next best thing instead: 

## 7 tips to get the most out of Minikube

**Use the Dashboard**

This is one of the best features for me. Type `minikube dashboard`, which starts the Web UI that lets you manage all your Kubernetes resources. You can even start a terminal in a pod for a quick debug.

**Periodically Reset Minikube**

Every now and then, delete the cluster with `minikube delete` and start a new one with `minikube start`. I've been bitten by strange networking problems in the past and they all cleared up everytime after resetting the cluster.

**SSH to the VM**

[Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/) runs a single-node Kubernetes on your laptop. Sometimes we need to log in to the VM to get a closer look. The problem is that it runs in headless mode, so we don't have a terminal window. But Minikube has a built-in ssh command for this: `minikube ssh`

**File Sync**

If you put a file in `$HOME/.minikube/files` it will automatically be copied into the VM when you start the cluster. 

For instance you can override the DNS servers in the VM like this:
```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.minikube/files/etc
$ echo nameserver 1.1.1.1 > ~/.minikube/files/etc/resolv.conf
$ minikube start
```

**Automount $HOME**

Did you know that if you start Minikube with `minikube start --mount` it automatically mounts `$HOME` in the VM? On my machine, home gets mapped to `/minikube-host` (which is different that [documented path](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/mount/)).

You can also mount any directory in the VM with:

```bash 
$ minikube mount /path/on/host:/path/on/vm &
```

**Try Different Versions**

It's a good idea to always use the same Kubernetes version that you have in production. You can change the local version with `--kubernetes-version`. For example:

```bash
$ minikube start --kubernetes-version="v1.18.5"
```

**Connect with Tunnel**

You may have noticed this when you deploy a load balancer service:

```bash
$ kubectl get service
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
my-service   LoadBalancer   10.97.97.121   <pending>      80:32446/TCP   88s
```

It never gets assigned an external IP.

At first, I didn't pay much attention to that, I just went with the links provided `minikube service --url SERVICE_NAME`.

But see what happens when you start a tunnel (do this on a second terminal)

```bash
$ minikube tunnel
```

Now suddenly the LoadBalancer service has an IP:
```bash
$ kubectl get service
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
my-service   LoadBalancer   10.97.97.121   10.97.97.121   80:32446/TCP   88s
```

And it should be connectable:

```bash
$ curl 10.97.97.121:80
```

<!-- The service has a valid IP now, and that's not all, you can connect to it as long as the tunnel is running. -->
<!-- 
Why I want it when I can just port forward?
minikube tunnel
minikube tunnel --cleanup
kubectl port-forward POD PORT:PORT -->

<!-- - Addons, did you know minikube has addons? I didn't.
minikube addons list
minikube addons enable metrics-server -->

I'm glad we have Minikube; it's an excellent way to try out and develop Kubernetes applications. I hope these tips helped you get the most out of it.
