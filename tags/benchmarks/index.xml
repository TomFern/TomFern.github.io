Network ðŸ”—Containers get connected to a bridge network by default. A software bridge that allows communication between containers running on the same host &amp;amp; bridge. We can also create and use custom bridges, to create isolated groups of containers. To allow connections from outside, we must map the host&amp;rsquo;s ports to a container&amp;rsquo;s with -p (publish e.g. -p 3306:3306) This is easy and flexible, but it makes Docker start an additional process (docker-proxy), which can use a non-trivial amount of CPU.</description></item><item><title>A Container for My Databases</title><link>/posts/a-container-for-my-databases/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2019 17:59:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>/posts/a-container-for-my-databases/</guid><description>Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like containers? Anyone doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to have most of the benefits of virtual machines with much, much less overhead?
They&amp;rsquo;ve been around since forever (anyone still remember chroot?) but only in recent years their popularity boomed, mainly due to cloud computing, I&amp;rsquo;m sure.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been running databases in docker for a while now. I was curious about other alternatives, so I did a bit of benchmarking.
Docker ðŸ”—It&amp;rsquo;s not a coincidence that Docker appeared around the same time container technology began its popularity rise.</description></item><item><title>The Cost of Idle Indexes</title><link>/posts/the-cost-of-idle-indexes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 12:36:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>/posts/the-cost-of-idle-indexes/</guid><description>The last few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been cleaning up indexes. This entails removing duplicate, unused or redundant indexes.
There were quite a lot of indexes, so it was hard work. I knew why this was important to do: as the table changes, indexes need to be kept updated, less indexes means less updates and less wasted resources.
But I wanted to have a real number to attach to the theory. How much benefit is there really?</description></item></channel></rss>
