It was a part-time gig in a government office. A few months in, they decided to go open-source full in. Out the window went Windows and in came Linux. At the time, I was doing PHP development, and I was sorry to have to let go of my dear Dreamweaver.
I decided that if I had to work on Linux, I would go all the way, no compromises for me.</description></item></channel></rss>
